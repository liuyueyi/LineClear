the line game used libgdx game engine to develop. In this project, i only use some basic class of libgdx, if you want get more, you can search the relative knowdge of libgdx.

You can only import the LineClear project into your development environment(such as eclipse), this is the whole complete android project. But there are some bugs you should attention, when the game is running, there may be the bug "mo response for your click", for this bug, i don't know why. Maybe somebody can tell me.
